Description: This wrapper package for 'mgcv' makes it easier to create high-performing Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). With its central function autogam(), by entering just a dataset and the name of the outcome column as inputs, 'AutoGAM' tries to automate the procedure of configuring a highly accurate GAM which performs at reasonably high speed, even for large datasets.
